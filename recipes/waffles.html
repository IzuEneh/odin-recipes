        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Belgian waffles are tender and flavorful waffles made with yeast. They're great 
        topped with butter, whipped cream and fresh fruit.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>active dry yeast</li>
            <li>warm milk</li>
            <li>egg yolk</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>white sugar</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>vanilla extract</li>
            <li>all purpose flour</li>
            <li>egg whites</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm milk. Let stand until creamy, 
            about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, 1/4 cup of the warm milk and the 
            melted butter. Stir in the yeast mixture, sugar, salt and vanilla. Stir in the 
            remaining 2 1/2 cups milk alternately with the flour, ending with the flour. Beat 
            the egg whites until they form soft peaks; fold into the batter. Cover the bowl 
            tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 
            1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the waffle iron. Brush with oil and spoon about 1/2 cup 
            (or as recommended by manufacturer) onto center of iron. Close the lid and bake 
            until it stops steaming and the waffle is golden brown. Serve immediately or 
            keep warm in 200 degree oven.</li>
        </ol>
